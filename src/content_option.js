With experience in CubeSat missions, space software development, and data science projects, I've honed my skills in Python, C++, F‚Äô Flight Software, and machine learning frameworks. At Space Dynamics Laboratory and the University Nanosatellite Program, I've contributed to cutting-edge aerospace projects while currently enhancing the SynthMining platform and developing advanced networking with Proxmox VE. In my free time, I love riding my Honda CBR300 motorcycle, organizing and attending rides, and casually gaming. I'm working towards a career that merges software engineering with innovative space systems.",
